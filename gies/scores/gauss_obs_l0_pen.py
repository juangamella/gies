        data : numpy.ndarray
            the nxp matrix containing the observations of each
            variable (each column corresponds to a variable).
        lmbda : float or NoneType, optional
            the regularization parameter. If None, defaults to the BIC

            observations.
        method : {'scatter', 'raw'}, optional
            the method used to compute the likelihood. If 'scatter',
            the empirical covariance matrix (i.e. scatter matrix) is
            used. If 'raw', the likelihood is computed from the raw
            data. In both cases an intercept is fitted.
        cache : bool, optional
           if computations of the local score should be cached for
           future calls. Defaults to True.
        debug : int, optional
            if larger than 0, debug are traces printed. Higher values
