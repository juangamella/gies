"""Module containing the code to compute the log-likelihood of a model
(connectivity and variances) from data of a single or multiple
environments. This module is different to log_likelihood_means in that
the means are always set to their MLE. This offers the possibility of
using precomputed sample covariance matrices (see full and local
