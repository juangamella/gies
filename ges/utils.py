# Functions for PDAG to CPDAG conversion

    # The following functions implement the conversion from PDAG to
    # CPDAG that is carried after each transition to a different
    # equivalence class, after the selection and application of the
    # highest scoring insert/delete/turn operator. It consists of the
    # succesive application of three algorithms, all described in
    # Appendix C (pages 552,553) of Chickering's 2002 GES paper
    # (www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/chickering02b/chickering02b.pdf).
    #
    # The algorithms are:

    #   1. Obtaining a consistent extension of a PDAG, implemented in
    #   the function pdag_to_dag.
    #
    #   2. Obtaining a total ordering of the edges of the extension
    #   resulting from (1). It is summarized in Fig. 13 of
    #   Chickering's paper and implemented in the function
    #   order_edges.
    #
    #   3. Labelling the edges as compelled or reversible, by which we
    #   can easily obtain the CPDAG. It is summarized in Fig. 14 of
    #   Chickering's paper and implemented in the function label_edges.

    # The above are put together in the function pdag_to_cpdag

    # NOTE!!!: Algorithm (1) is from the 1992 paper "A simple
    # algorithm to construct a consistent extension of a partially
    # oriented graph" by Dorit Dor and Michael Tarsi. There is an
    # ERROR in the summarized version in Chickering's paper. In
    # particular, the condition that N_x U Pa_x is a clique is not
    # equivalent to the condition from Dor & Torsi that every neighbor
    # of X should be adjacent to all of X's adjacent nodes. The
    # condition summarized in Chickering is more restrictive (i.e. it
    # also asks that the parents of X are adjacent to each other), but
    # this only results in an error for some graphs, and was only
    # uncovered during exhaustive testing.
